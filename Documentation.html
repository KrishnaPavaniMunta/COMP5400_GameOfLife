        <div>
            John Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton created in 1970 that progresses solely based on its initial configuration. The game's rules of birth, death and survival are determined by the conditions of its immediate neighbours. It is often used to simulate social and biological behaviours, illustrating how complex behaviours can emerge over time from a set of simple rules. However, the game is deterministic in nature, and this project aims to introduce non-deterministic rules to the game to incorporate elements of randomness that align more closely with real-life societies.
        </div>
        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>This project aims to explore the impact of stochastic or non-deterministic modifications on the classical Game of Life rules, examining how random alterations in cell deaths lead to new population growth patterns and emergent structures.</p>

                <h3>Game of Life Original</h3>
                <p>This file includes the original implementation of the Game of Life following all the traditional rules as defined by John Conway. The rules
                    of the game are implemented through the <i> Upgrade Grid</i> function. 
                    These rules are as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If a living cell has zero or one neighbours, it will die due to loneliness.</li>
                    <li>If a living cell has more than four neighbours, it will die due to overcrowding.</li>
                    <li>If a dead cell is surrounded by exactly three neighbors, a birth will occur, and the cell will become alive.</li>
                </ul>

                <ol>
                        <li><strong>Emergent Patterns:</strong> Despite its simple rules, the Game of Life can give rise to complex and interesting patterns. These emergent patterns can provide insights into how simple rules can lead to complex behaviours.</li>
                        <li><strong>Stable Patterns:</strong> Configurations that remain unchanged over multiple generations. These stable patterns include still lifes, such as blocks and beehives, where cells remain fixed in position.</li>
                        <li><strong>Oscillators:</strong> Oscillators are patterns that cycle through a set of configurations repeatedly. They can be simple, like blinkers and toads, or more complex, like pentadecathlons and pulsars.</li>
                        <li><strong>Spaceships:</strong> Some patterns move across the grid over time. These are called spaceships or gliders. They maintain their overall shape as they move, often leaving behind a trail of stable patterns or oscillators.</li>
                        <li><strong>Growth and Decay:</strong> Some patterns may grow indefinitely, while others may stabilise or eventually die out.</li>
                        <li><strong>Interaction of Patterns:</strong> Different patterns interact with each other. They can collide, merge, or influence each other's behaviour in unexpected ways.</li>
                        <li><strong>Self-Replication:</strong> Some configurations in the Game of Life can self-replicate, creating copies of themselves as they evolve. These replicators are fascinating examples of emergent complexity.</li>
                        <li><strong>Edge Effects:</strong> Because the grid is finite, patterns near the edges may exhibit different behaviours compared to those in the central region.</li>

                <h3>Game of Life with Sacrifice Rules</h3>
                <p>This file includes the implementation of a modified Game of Life where the alive cells play a pre-game before every generation called "n-die
                    game". In this pre-game, a cell decides if it wnats to to sacrifice itself if it has "n" neighbors. This is done through a random sequence of the live cells
                    which dictates the order in which cells are checked for the presence of n neighbours. Followin this, the traditional rules are applied. The Upgrade Grid function incorporates the sacrifice rules adopted from the referenced paper by
                    <a href = "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/393586">M.R.lauer et al., (1995)</a>.</p>
                <p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Number of neighbours required for a cell to sacrifice itself is required as an input, "n".</li>
                    <li>Variations of population dynamics for different "n" values.</li>
                    <li>When "n = 2", new stable patterns other than the defined ones in Conway's Game of Life emerge.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Game of Life with Selfish Rules</h3>
                <p>This file includes the implementation of the Game of Life with modified rules where a cell can exhibit selfishness based on a
                    given percentage of selfish births. It introduces the concept of vitality which allows cells to survive events that would naturally lead to their death. Although, 
                    for every generation they survive such events, their vitality reduces by one. The Upgrade Grid function incorporates the selfish rules as described and adopted 
                    from the referenced paper by
                    <a href = "https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation?paperid=49054">Mühlenbernd, R. and Schulz, S. (2014)</a></p>
                <p>The new rules are defined as:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>A cell can survive overcrowding by eliminating its neighbours when surrounded by four or more cells.</li>
                    <li>A cell can survive uderpopulation even if it has no or one neighbor, as long as its vitality factor is greater than or equal to one.</li>
                    <li>The third rule allows for births in an empty cell with three or four neighbors.</li>
                    <li>Finally, the fourth rule designates a new cell as selfish based on a given level of selfishness that
                        is a parameter of the population.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>This file includes the implementation of the Game of Life with modifications that introduce the concept of probability is introduced into the event of cell deaths.
                    Additionally, weighted masks are introduced to vary the influence of the neighbours in the total number of neighbours and hence, in the outcome of the cell's state. The Upgrade Grid function upgrades the
                    rules as described and adopted from the paper by <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258113918_Self-controlled_growth_coherent_shrinkage_eternal_life_in_a_self-bounded_space_and_other_amazing_evolutionary_dynamics_of_stochastic_pattern_formation_and_growth_models_inspired_by_Conways_Game_of_Lif">Leonid Yaroslavsky </a>.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>The "Deaths" of "live" cells are made stochastic with a certain probability, Pdeath, which determines the likelihood of a live cell to die.</li>
                    <li>The number of "live" cells in the 8-neighbourhood of each cell is counted using a weighted summation which is rounded up to determine the total neighbour count.</li>
