        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>The aim of this project is to analyze the emergent behavior of cells when the initial rules of Conway's Game of Life are modified. By changing the rules to non-deterministic ones and introducing new behaviors such as selfishness, sacrifice, and stochastic growth, we aim to deepen our understanding of cellular automata.</p>

                <h3>Game of Life Original</h3>
                <p>This file is the original implementation of the Game of Life following all the nature's rules. The Upgrade
                    Grid function is designed to continuously update the grid by checking the rules of Conway's Game of Life.
                    These rules are as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If a living cell has zero or one neighbors, it will die due to loneliness. It will also die if it has
                        more than four neighbors.</li>
                    <li>If a dead cell is surrounded by exactly three neighbors, a birth will occur, and the cell will become
                        alive.</li>
                </ul>

                <ol>
                    <p>Can produce highly complex patterns depending on the initial configurations.</p>
                        <li><strong>Emergent Patterns:</strong> Despite its simple rules, the Game of Life can give rise to complex and interesting patterns. These emergent patterns can provide insights into how simple rules can lead to complex behaviors.</li>
                        <li><strong>Stable Patterns:</strong> Configurations that remain unchanged over multiple generations. These stable patterns include still lifes, such as blocks and beehives, where cells remain fixed in position.</li>
                        <li><strong>Oscillators:</strong> Oscillators are patterns that cycle through a set of configurations repeatedly. They can be simple, like blinkers and toads, or more complex, like pentadecathlons and pulsars.</li>
                        <li><strong>Spaceships:</strong> Some patterns move across the grid over time. These are called spaceships or gliders. They maintain their overall shape as they move, often leaving behind a trail of stable patterns or oscillators.</li>
                        <li><strong>Growth and Decay:</strong> Some patterns may grow indefinitely, while others may stabilize or eventually die out.</li>
                        <li><strong>Interaction of Patterns:</strong> Different patterns interact with each other. They can collide, merge, or influence each other's behavior in unexpected ways.</li>
                        <li><strong>Self-Replication:</strong> Some configurations in the Game of Life can self-replicate, creating copies of themselves as they evolve. These replicators are fascinating examples of emergent complexity.</li>
                        <li><strong>Edge Effects:</strong> Because the grid is finite, patterns near the edges may exhibit different behaviors compared to those in the central region.</li>

                <h3>Game of Life with Sacrifice Rules</h3>
                <p>This file implements the Game of Life with modified rules where the alive cells play a pregame called "n-die
                    game". The cells play the pregame where the cell sacrifices itself if it has "n" neighbors, and then the
                    nature rules apply. The Upgrade Grid function incorporates the sacrifice rules inspired as described in the paper by
                    <a href = "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/393586">M.R.lauer et al., (1995)</a>.</p>
                <p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Number of neighbors when sacrifice happens can be given as input "n".</li>
                    <li>Optimization of population for "n" values.</li>
                    <li>When "n = 2", new stable patterns other than the defined ones in Conway's Game of Life.</li>

                <p>This file implements the Game of Life with modified rules where a cell can exhibit selfishness based on a
                    given percentage. The Upgrade Grid function incorporates the selfish rules inspired as described in the paper by
                    <a href = "https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation?paperid=49054">Mühlenbernd, R. and Schulz, S. (2014)</a></p>
                <p>The rules are defined as:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The first rule states that a cell can survive by eliminating its neighbors if it is surrounded by four
                        or more cells.</li>
                    <li>The second rule allows a cell to survive even if it has no or one neighbor, as long as its vitality
                        factor is greater than or equal to one.</li>
                    <li>The third rule allows for births in an empty cell with three or four neighbors.</li>
                    <li>Finally, the fourth rule designates a new cell as selfish based on a given level of selfishness that
                        is a parameter of the population.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
                <ol>

                <h3>Game of Life with Death Probability</h3>
                <p>This file implements the Game of Life with modified rules where probability is introduced into the cell death
                    and additional weighted masks are introduced to neighbors count. The Upgrade Grid function upgrades the
                    rules inspired as mentioned in the paper by <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258113918_Self-controlled_growth_coherent_shrinkage_eternal_life_in_a_self-bounded_space_and_other_amazing_evolutionary_dynamics_of_stochastic_pattern_formation_and_growth_models_inspired_by_Conways_Game_of_Lif">Leonid Yaroslavsky </a>.</p>
                <p>The modifications made to the standard Conway's model are done in two ways:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The "Deaths" of "live" cells are made stochastic with a certain probability 1/Pdeath, which is a model
                        parameter.</li>
                    <li>The number of "live" cells in the 8-neighborhood of each cell is counted using a weighted summation
                        with rounding up the summation result instead of a simple summation of their binary values.</li>
                </ol>
